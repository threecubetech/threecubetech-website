        Whether you create technology products or use them to implement business solutions for your company, all technical leaders confront the complexities brought on by rapidly evolving technologies and business models, shorter deadlines, and limited resources. They must work through multiple obstacles in order to deliver innovation.

From core development, testing and DevOps, to making data digitally available, or migrating to the cloud, your infrastructure is in a state of constant flux. Whether it’s integrating new applications and technologies; modernizing software products to extend availability; or reformatting apps to be sold through new channels, the complexity keeps increasing. And, in the midst of all this change, you’re tasked with transforming old ways of working and delivering products, while introducing modern methods, frameworks, and technologies.
